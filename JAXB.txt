- DOM, SAX, XML Binding

XML binding:
- objects are instances of class, XML files are unstances of XSD
- XSD : xml schema
- from XSD auto generate class
- class is annotated with annotations from JAXB library (part of JRE)
- marshal : objects -> XML
- unmarshal : XML -> objects

XML file -> XSD file : by 

cooked:
1. File -> New -> Other -> JAXB Project -> provide a target runtime(some JDK or install GlassFish tools)
(JAXB uses XJC exam which is only in JDK not in JRE for class generation and application)
Add JDK to Java runtimes in preference if you are unable to find it in DDL
2. 

1) Select File->New ->Project
     2) Choose JAXB Project from JAXB and click Next
     3) Give Project Name and click Next
     4) On the next window, just Click Next
     5) On the next window (titled JAXB Facets), Choose "User Library" for JAXB implementation. 
        Click "Download Library.." picture and choose EclipseLink 2.5.2 
        (or the higher version shown in the window) and click Next
        This will install the library (make sure your are connected to internet.)
		
Keep JavaEE as perspective in Eclipse
New -> Other -> JAXB classes from Schema ==> generate class

Using Marshaller, we can save objects to XML file
Using Unmarshaller, we can read objects from an XML file
